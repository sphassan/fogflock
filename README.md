<h1>FogFlock</h1>
<h3>A hack made at TAMUHack 2016</h3>
FogFlock uses an recursive algorithm based weighting mutual following connections between artists on SoundCloud to find related artists "filling in the gaps" between the given "base" artists. Mutual connections are used to generate 'relevancy' weights which are summed up per-connection to derive the list of mutually followed artists who are the "most relevant" to the input artists. The most relevant artists are added to the list and the algorithm reiterates. The output is a beautiful, mobile, social, and local friendly revolutionary web based output which gives the user a list of artists most like the ones they inputted.

Rico, a lazy DJ who wanted a tool to find similar artists easily; and Sean, who really had nothing better to do with his weekend.
